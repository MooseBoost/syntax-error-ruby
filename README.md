# Syntax Error

## Background

Syntax error pretty common, even for experienced developers, so it's important that you learn how to find and fix them.

## Objectives

The file `syntax_error.rb` has, you guessed it, one or many syntax errors. Your task is to fix them.

## Instructions

1. Run your test suite to verify that there are syntax errors. 
2. Look at the file `syntax_error.rb`. Do you see any errors?
  * If not, manually run the syntax_error.rb file with: `ruby syntax_error.rb`. The error(s) that get returned will give you line numbers so you know where to look.
3. After you've fixed all the errors, remember to submit a pull request!
